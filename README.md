## About this project

This was an assignment in the Networking Achitecture class at BGSU. We were assigned to write an smtp Client and a proxy server in any language of our choosing. My group chose python.

## How to run:
### Proxy server:

<code> python proxy.py </code>
Made using normal python. Possibly works in python3

### SMTP Client:

<code> python smtpClient.py < hostname or ip> < port Number> < Sender email> < Receiving email> < Message body> < optional: attachment> </code>
